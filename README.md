An easy way to start building universal/isomorphic JavaScript applications that talk to a WordPress backend. Right on!

## What's inside?

We used the [`react-redux-universal-hot-example`](https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example) 
boilerplate as our starting point, however lots has changed since then and the two are now quite different. 
Thanks go to the creator and maintainers of the aforementioned repo.

```js
// Tools/libraries/features
Express, stage-0 ES2015, React, React Router, Redux, Kasia, 
Redux Sagas, Redux Dev Tools, SCSS, Webpack, Hot Reloading
```

## Getting Started

### Set up WordPress

We aim to release an Ansible script which will do all of this for you, but for now...

- Install wordpress at `localhost/wordpress` (or somewhere else; change accordingly in `src/config.js`)
- Install and enable these plugins: [`WP API REST JSON API v2`](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/), [`WP API MENUS`](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-api-menus/)
- Create two pages with slugs `homepage` and `posts`
- Create a menu (Appearance > Menus) called `'primary'` containing the two pages you just created
- Create some Posts

### Get the application

- Clone this repo: `git clone <url> wp-app`
- Change into it: `cd wp-app`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Configure the application in `src/config.js`

### Start the app

As a developer:

- `npm run dev`

By default the web server is at localhost:3000

<p>______</p>

In production:

- `npm run build`
- `npm start`

By default the web server is at localhost:8080
